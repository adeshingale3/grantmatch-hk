# GrantMatch – Hackathon MVP Documentation

---

## 🔍 What is GrantMatch?

GrantMatch is a **decentralized, AI-powered grant discovery and DAO voting platform** designed to help underrepresented founders — especially women-led NGOs and grassroots startups — find and apply for funding, while enabling transparent, community-driven funding decisions.

It combines Web3, AI, and reputation-based systems to reimagine how small projects get discovered, supported, and celebrated.

---

## 🚨 The Problem

- **Difficult discovery:** Women-led or rural initiatives struggle to find relevant grants.
- **Manual effort:** Proposal writing and submission is time-consuming and scattered.
- **Lack of trust:** Funders lack transparent metrics and proof of impact or reputation.

---

## 💡 The Solution

GrantMatch solves this with a clean, powerful experience:

1. **AI-Powered Grant Matching**: A chatbot helps founders discover relevant grants.
2. **Decentralized Voting**: DAOs and individuals vote on proposals using on-chain tokens.
3. **NFT-Based Profiles**: Each founder and funder gets an NFT identity that evolves with their journey.
