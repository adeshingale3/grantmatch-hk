# Wallet Address Saving Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem
After connecting the wallet, the address was not being saved in the profiles table.

## Root Cause
The wallet linking functionality existed but was not being called reliably when the wallet connected. The previous implementation relied on useEffect in the Header component which could miss wallet connection events.

## Solution Implemented

### Step 1: Enhanced useWallet Hook
Modified `src/lib/useWallet.ts` to support callback functionality:

- Added `onConnectCallback` state to store a callback function
- Modified both the Phantom event listener and manual connect function to call the callback
- Added `setOnConnect` function to allow components to register a callback
- The callback is called with the connected `PublicKey` whenever the wallet connects

### Step 2: Updated Header Component
Modified `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` to use the new callback mechanism:

- Added `useCallback` import for proper dependency management
- Moved `handleLinkWallet` definition before the useEffect that uses it
- Added a useEffect that sets up the wallet callback when a user is logged in
- Simplified the connect button handlers since the callback now handles linking automatically
- The callback automatically calls `handleLinkWallet` whenever the wallet connects

### Step 3: Automatic Wallet Linking Flow
The new flow ensures wallet addresses are saved:

1. User signs in to the application
2. Header component sets up the wallet callback via `setOnConnect(handleLinkWallet)`
3. When user clicks "Connect Wallet", the wallet connects
4. The callback automatically triggers `handleLinkWallet`
5. `handleLinkWallet` calls the Supabase `link-wallet` function
6. The wallet address is saved to the profiles table

## Key Improvements

1. **Reliability**: Callback-based approach ensures wallet linking happens every time
2. **Automatic**: No manual calls needed in button handlers
3. **Consistent**: Works for both manual connections and auto-reconnections
4. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling and user feedback
5. **TypeScript Safe**: Proper typing and dependency management

## Testing Steps

1. Start the development environment:
   ```
   npm run dev
   supabase start
   ```

2. Open http://localhost:5173/

3. Sign in with a test account

4. Click "Connect Wallet" button

5. Connect your Phantom wallet

6. Check the browser console for success message: "Wallet successfully linked to profile: [address]"

7. Verify in Supabase Studio (http://localhost:54323) that the wallet_address is saved in the profiles table

## Files Modified

- `src/lib/useWallet.ts` - Added callback functionality
- `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` - Updated to use callbacks and proper dependency management

## Database Schema

The wallet address is saved to the `profiles` table in the `wallet_address` column (TEXT UNIQUE). The `link-wallet` Supabase Edge Function ensures:

- No duplicate wallet addresses across different users
- Proper error handling for conflicts
- Secure server-side validation

## Error Handling

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling:

- Network errors when calling Supabase functions
- Wallet already linked to another account
- Missing user or wallet data
- Database update failures

All errors are displayed to the user in the Header component.
